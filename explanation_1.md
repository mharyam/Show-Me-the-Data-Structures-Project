# Explanation for each question 

1) LRU CACHE:
    I used a dictionary as my data structure to get and set values
    The Time complexity is  O(n) because dictionary is a hashmap
    The space complexity is 0(n)
   

2) FILE RECURSION:
    I am using recursion in here, so the Time complexity is 0(n) 
   

3) Huffman Coding: 
    I used a Node class and then stored all the node data in 
    a list
   The time complexity is 0(log(n))
    The space complexity is 0(n)
 
   

4) Active Directory:
   I am using a list to add all the group and users 
    The worst case is  O(n) 
    The space complexity is 0(n)

   

5)Block Chain:
    I am using Linked list to append and get
    The Time complexity is O(1) 
    The space complexity is 0(n)


6) Union and Intersection:
    I am using Linked list to add and get intersection 
    The worst case is 0(n), because it loops through both linked list to get result 
    The space complexity is 0(n)
