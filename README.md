# Show-Me-the-Data-Structures-Project


This project cover a variety of topics related to the data structures.

1) Least Recently Used Cache: An LRU cache is a type of cache in which we remove the least recently used entry when the cache memory reaches its limit.

2) File Recursion: For this problem, the goal is to write code for finding all files under a directory (and all directories beneath it) that end with ".c"

3) Data Compression: Data compression with Huffman Coding

4)  Active Directory: In Windows Active Directory, a group can consist of user(s) and group(s) themselves.

5) Blockchain: this project uses linked lists and hashing to create a blockchain implementation.

6) Union and Intersection of Two Linked Lists: we use two linked lists and return a linked list that is composed of either the union or intersection, respectively
